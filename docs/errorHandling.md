# Error Handling and HTTP Status Codes

This document explains the error handling strategy and the use of HTTP status codes in our API. We use specific status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request and to ensure proper interaction with clients, such as websites or mobile applications.

## HTTP Status Codes

### 200 OK

- **Usage**: We use the HTTP status code `200 OK` to indicate that an API request has been successfully processed.
- **Scenario**: This status code is used for successful POST requests, indicating that the data has been successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server.
- **Reasoning**: Using the 200 status code for successful postings is standard practice and ensures that client websites recognize the request as successful. This is especially important when the client is expected to take action upon successful posting, such as sending confirmation emails or updating a user interface.

### 201 Created

- **Usage**: We use the HTTP status code `201` to indicate that a retrieval of information was successful.
- **Scenario**: This status code is used mainly for when information is successfully retrieved from the server.
- **Reasoning**: Using the 201 status code for successful retrievals helps us distinguish between postings and retrievals. By doing this, we can ensure that client websites do not treat retrievals as postings, preventing duplicate sending of emails or any unintended side effects of a successful posting.

### 400 Bad Request

- **Usage**: We use the HTTP status code `400` to indicate that the server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax or missing information.
- **Scenario**: This status code is used when the client sends information that doesn’t meet the API’s requirements, such as missing required fields, or data in an incorrect format.
- **Reasoning**: Using the 400 status code to indicate that information was not successfully posted is standard practice. This informs the client that the request was malformed or missing necessary information, and no action has been taken by the server.

## Handling Errors in Client

Clients should check the HTTP status code of the response to determine the result of their API request. Based on the status code, the client can then decide the appropriate action, such as resending the request, displaying an error message, or proceeding with a successful operation.

## Conclusion

Properly using HTTP status codes is essential for clear communication between the server and client. It allows clients to understand the result of their requests and take appropriate action based on the outcome.
